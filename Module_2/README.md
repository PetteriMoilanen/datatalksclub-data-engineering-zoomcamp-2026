# Solutions to Module 2 homework - Kestra stuff

## Things I've done:

- Created [my own version of the Kestra flow](module2_gc_setup.yaml) to create the GC bucket and BQ dataset: 
- The service account JSON credentials written into .env file (project root, git ignored) as SECRET_GCP_CREDS env variable that the setup flow uses.
